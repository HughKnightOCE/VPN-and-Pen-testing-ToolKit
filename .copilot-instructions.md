# Copilot Instructions

These are the custom instructions for working with this VPN Proxy + Pentesting Toolkit project.

## Core Principles

### 1. Subagent Usage
- **Always use subagents** for complex, multi-step tasks
- Use the `Plan` agent for research, architecture decisions, and feature planning
- Leverage subagents to distribute workload and ensure specialized handling
- Each agent should have clear, specific instructions for their role

### 2. GitHub Integration
- **Always push to GitHub** after completing any meaningful work
- Commit with descriptive messages that explain what was added/changed
- Keep the repository in sync with local changes
- Include progress updates in commit messages when applicable

### 3. Continuous Improvement
- **Always suggest next improvements** at the end of each work session
- Analyze what was built and identify potential enhancements
- Provide specific, actionable suggestions tailored to the project
- Consider scalability, security, performance, and user experience

## Workflow

### Before Starting Work
1. Clarify requirements with the user
2. Use Plan subagent to outline approach (for complex tasks)
3. Break down into logical steps

### During Development
1. Write clean, well-documented code
2. Test implementations as they're created
3. Handle errors gracefully with informative messages

### After Completing Tasks
1. Commit and push all changes to GitHub
2. Provide summary of what was accomplished
3. **Suggest 3-5 specific next improvements** for the project
4. Explain why each improvement matters

## Project Context

**Current Status:** Fully functional VPN Proxy + Pentesting Toolkit
- Backend: Python Flask with SOCKS5 proxy, encryption, and pentesting tools
- Frontend: React with real-time monitoring and tool interface
- GitHub: https://github.com/HughKnightOCE/VPN-and-Pen-testing-ToolKit

**Key Technologies:**
- Python 3.14, Flask 3.1.2, Cryptography 46.0.4
- React 18, Vite 4.5.14, Recharts
- SOCKS5 Proxy, AES-256 Encryption, DNS Handler

## Improvement Areas to Consider

### High Priority
- [ ] User authentication system
- [ ] Database integration for persistence
- [ ] Advanced reporting and export features
- [ ] Enhanced error handling and logging

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Additional pentesting tools (CSRF, XXE, LFI/RFI)
- [ ] Performance optimization and caching
- [ ] Multi-user support with role-based access
- [ ] API rate limiting and security hardening

### Lower Priority
- [ ] Mobile app companion
- [ ] Advanced analytics dashboard
- [ ] Machine learning threat detection
- [ ] Cloud deployment automation

## Success Criteria

✅ Code is production-quality
✅ All changes are version controlled
✅ Documentation is kept up-to-date
✅ Next steps are always clear
✅ User stays informed of progress
